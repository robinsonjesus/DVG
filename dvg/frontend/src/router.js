/*
Create Routes

Now that you’ve installed Vue Router, you need to configure Vue to use Vue Router.
You’ll also need to configure Vue Router with the URL paths it should route.
Create a router.js module in the src/ directory.
This file will hold all the configuration about which URLs map to which Vue components.
Start by importing Vue and Vue Router:
*/

import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

// Add the following imports, which each correspond to a component you’ll create shortly:

import Post from '@/components/Post'
import Author from '@/components/Author'
import PostsByTag from '@/components/PostsByTag'
import AllPosts from '@/components/AllPosts'

Vue.use(VueRouter)

const routes = [
    { path: '/author/:username', component: Author },
    { path: '/post/:slug', component: Post },
    { path: '/tag/:tag', component: PostsByTag },
    { path: '/', component: AllPosts },
]


const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: routes,
    mode: 'history',
})

export default router
